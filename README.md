# playground-async-render
Try out async rendering. Make it so components on the server can get data, and
we like respect that.

## Todos
- [ ] create a component that needs data
- [ ] update bankai to respect the component's field to need data (extend state?)
- [ ] update nanocomponent to integrate this. Alternatively
  choo-component-preview.
